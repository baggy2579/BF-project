# Convert the data to a time series object
# This reshapes the dataset into a time series starting from January 2015 with a monthly frequency.

job_openings_ts <- ts(monthly_values, start = c(2015, 1), frequency = 12)

# Handle missing values
# Replace any NA values in the dataset with the mean to ensure proper model functionality.

# Plot the time series
# This graph shows the trend and any recurring patterns over time in job openings data.

# Decompose the time series
# Break the series into trend, seasonal, and random components to better understand the structure of the data.
decomposed <- decompose(job_openings_ts, type = "multiplicative")
plot(decomposed)

# Explanation:
# - Trend: Shows the long-term direction of job openings.
# - Seasonal: Highlights recurring monthly patterns, such as spikes during hiring seasons.
# - Random: Displays irregular variations not explained by trend or seasonality.

# Naive Forecast
# Assumes future values will equal the most recent observed value.
naive_model <- naive(job_openings_ts, h = 12)
plot(naive_model)

# Explanation:
# Naive forecasting is a simple baseline model. Itâ€™s useful for comparison but lacks consideration of trends or seasonality.

# Residual analysis
# Analyze the residuals (differences between actual and forecasted values) to evaluate model fit.
naive_residuals <- residuals(naive_model)
plot(naive_residuals, main = "Residuals of Naive Model")

# Explanation:
# Residuals should have no visible pattern if the model is appropriate. Patterns indicate the need for a more advanced model.

# Simple Moving Average
# Smoothing reduces noise in the time series, highlighting the overall trend.
moving_avg <- ma(job_openings_ts, order = 12)
plot(job_openings_ts, main = "Job Openings with Moving Average", ylab = "Job Openings")
lines(moving_avg, col = "red", lwd = 2)

# Explanation:
# The moving average (red line) smooths out short-term fluctuations and emphasizes the long-term trend in job openings.

# Simple Exponential Smoothing
# Suitable for series without strong trends or seasonality.
ses_model <- ses(job_openings_ts, h = 12)
plot(ses_model)

# Explanation:
# Exponential smoothing uses weighted averages of past data to forecast future values. It is effective for non-seasonal data.

# Holt-Winters Model
# Captures both trend and seasonality for improved forecasting.
hw_model <- HoltWinters(job_openings_ts)
hw_forecast <- forecast(hw_model, h = 12)
plot(hw_forecast)

# Explanation:
# The Holt-Winters model is ideal for data with seasonality and trends. It adjusts to changing patterns over time.

# Compare model performance

# Explanation:
# Lower values of MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) indicate better model accuracy.
# This helps in choosing the most reliable model for forecasting.

# Final Forecast Plot
# Highlights the most promising model (Holt-Winters) for a 12-month forecast.

# Explanation:
# Shows predicted values for the next 12 months based on the best-fit model.

# Fit a linear regression model
time_index <- 1:length(monthly_values)
data <- data.frame(Month_Index = time_index, Openings = as.vector(monthly_values))
reg_model <- lm(Openings ~ Month_Index, data = data)

# Regression Summary
summary(reg_model)

# Explanation:
# The regression model identifies the linear trend in job openings over time. 
# Coefficients indicate how job openings change with each passing month.

# Plot the regression line

# Explanation:
# Blue points represent actual data, and the red line shows the predicted trend based on the regression model.

# Perform Differencing to Check Stationarity
# Stationarity is a key assumption for ARIMA models.
ndiffs(job_openings_ts)  # Determine the number of differences needed
job_openings_diff <- diff(job_openings_ts, differences = 1)
tsdisplay(job_openings_diff)

# Explanation:
# Differencing removes trends to make the series stationary, enabling ARIMA modeling.

# Fit ARIMA Model
auto_fit <- auto.arima(job_openings_ts, trace = TRUE, stepwise = FALSE)
print(auto_fit)

# Explanation:
# ARIMA combines autoregressive (AR) and moving average (MA) components with differencing (I) for robust modeling.

# Perform Forecast for the Next Five Periods
# Uses the ARIMA model to forecast job openings for five months ahead.
forecast_plot <- forecast(auto_fit, h = 5, level = c(99.5))
plot(forecast_plot, main = "ARIMA Model Forecast for Job Openings", ylab = "Job Openings")

# Explanation:
# The ARIMA forecast predicts job openings for the next five months. Shaded areas indicate confidence intervals, reflecting uncertainty.
